# How do I compile/run my code

Use `javac.sh` to compile on Linux and Mac OS, or `javac.bat` to compile on Windows. Likewise, use `java.sh` to run on Linux and Mac OS, or `java.bat` to run on Windows. E.g.

```
$ cd comp16412-coursework-1_username
$ ./javac.sh src/MazeApplication.java  
$ ./java.sh MazeApplication
```

# How do I compile/run the tests?

We've supplied a shell file, `run_tests.sh`, that should work on Linux/Mac OS.

The file `run_tests.bat` should do the same thing on Windows. This file is purely for your convenience and (a) won't be used in marking, (b) isn't something we're going to provide lots of support for!
